# python-api-challenge

In  this API Analysis we look to evaluate different weather statistics based on city's latitude and longitude. This is then projected onto a google maps to show a heatmap. This is done using API pulls to google maps.

### Goals to accomplish


* Drop values that are not in the dataset from the API pull.

* Can we create a Dataframe to determine an ideal temperature to include in our heatmap.

* use linear regression to compare data.

* Use the google API calls to find first hotel for each city located within 5000 meters of our coordinates.

* Plot the hotels on our google heatmap.


Observational trends are after the linear regression charts in Weather data
PNG files of heatmaps are in output data file for Vacation
